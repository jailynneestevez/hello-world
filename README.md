A place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others

I am a strong advocate for building and improving justice systems that ensure fairness, promote safety, and strengthen communities. At Bennington College, I am Head of High School Mentoring and Lead Member of Women's Group for GANAS, a student-run course, where I provide outreach and assistance to the migrant and undocumented communities in the surrounding areas of Vermont and New York. As a long-time member and leader, I understand the importance of organization and maintaining a positive and professional organizational image when acting as a liaison among clients, departments, and the general public. I can independently handle multiple tasks, work with a wide variety of technologies, and develop rapport and communicate effectively with diverse constituencies. 

My approach to education thus far can be demonstrated by the various internship opportunities I have sought out. It is from these experiences that after my undergraduate degree, I will be seeking to enter the workforce to explore the legal field, with the intent to attend law school afterward.
